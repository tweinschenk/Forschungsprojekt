# Neural Networks as Error Estimators
Numerical simulations are used in a variety of computational problems. The error of the simulation is often of interest here. However, the error is usually not known and must be calculated using expensive methods such as adjoint error equations. We investigate the use of multiple Convulational Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures as efficient and reliable error estimators for muscle fiber simulations by opendihu.

# Requirements
To run this project you need to have [opendihu](https://github.com/maierbn/opendihu) successfully installed. In addition you need a python3 environment with ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``scikit-learn`` and ``tensorflow``.

# Run the project
Open the ``Main.ipynb`` in your favorite IPython-Notebook editor, e.g. JupyterLab and follow the steps described there.
